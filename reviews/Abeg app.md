# Abeg App Diary Study

## Setting up

- Login Page comes up as a default
- taps signup button and gets taken to the signup page
- Enters required details and taps "sign up" button
- loads for a while
- Verification page comes up and requires a code sent to your email
- put the numbers in
- Required to enter Bank Verification Number (BVN) *the BVN serves as a form of verification for the details you used to signup. Here is was skeptical about putting in that number because it's a sensitive information but after I read the information they put in about what they needed it for and that it wouldn't have any negative implications on my bank account, I wasn't worried anymore *
- When the BVN is confirmed, you'd be required to create an Abeg tag. 
- Redirected  to the home page



## Funding Wallet

### Method 1: By bank transfer

- Tap the Abeg app logo on the top of the screen 

- the logo will be replaced by "Fund my wallet"

- tap "fund my wallet" and a modal comes up with a bank account number which can be copied

- copy the bank account number and make a transfer to it via your bank. *after the transfer, the money I sent didn't show up immediately after the transaction was confirmed as successful on my mobile banking app*

- Now tapping on the Abeg logo will reveal your balance temporarily.

  

### Method 2: Requesting from a contact

- The home page, put in the amount you want to send
- put in a description of the payment *this could be the reason for requesting the money*
