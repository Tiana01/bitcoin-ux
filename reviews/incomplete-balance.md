# Incomplete Balance

- Received a bitcoin payment in ***pine wallet***
- restored the ***pine wallet*** (which uses version 2 addresses) into a new wallet called ***electrum*** (which uses version 3 addresses) by typing in the pine wallet recovery / seed phrase
- on electrum, two bitcoin payments were received.
- Then, the pine wallet was imported into another wallet called ***Blue wallet*** (which also uses version 3 addresses)
- The result of this was an incomplete wallet balance as only the transactions / payments received on ***electrum*** showed up on ***blue wallet***. The previous balance on pine wallet did not show up.
